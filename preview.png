> Implemented using spcr-settings
> 
> NOTE:
> Currently the button class spcr-settings uses is outdated so your buttons are gonna be pretty ugly until it gets fixed <br>
> I already opened a [pull request](https://github.com/FlafyDev/spicetify-creator-plugins/pull/10) that fixes the issue

Enabling "Use metadata cache" and "Use tracklist cache" speeds up searches and playing a lot, however it also takes up space in Spotify's local storage which is limited to ~10MB. 
<br>
Each track takes up ~0.2-0.4KB, so keep that in mind when caching large amounts of playlists like me. 
<br>
In the event that you get a notification saying "Maximum local storage qouta reached!", use the "Remove tracklist cache" button.
<br>
To see how much space is being used by tags use the "Copy local storage key sizes" option.

The import/export tags option can be used to import tags from other users as well, you can get my tags here:
