> Implemented using spcr-settings

Enabling "Use metadata cache" and "Use tracklist cache" speeds up searches and playing a lot, however it also takes up space in Spotify's local storage which is limited to ~10MB. 
<br>
Each track takes up ~0.2-0.4KB, so keep that in mind when caching large amounts of playlists like me. 
<br>
In the event that you get a notification saying "Maximum local storage qouta reached!", use the "Remove tracklist cache" button.
<br>
To see how much space is being used by tags use the "Copy local storage key sizes" option.

The import/export tags option can be used to import tags from other users as well, you can get my tags here: 
- https://gist.github.com/Bergbok/c7503bcb7ba2699ae10830b5aacbf333 (takes up ~2MB of local storage)

Threshold for [artist:VA] tag corresponds to the amount of artists a playlist can contain before it gets tagged as [artist:VA] instead.
