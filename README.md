# Auto Skip Tracks by Duration

Allows you to automatically skip tracks based on their duration.<br>
Especially useful if your local files collection contains SFX you'd prefer to skip.

Be careful not to cause any skipping loops by playing albums/playlists where no songs fall between your specified durations!

1. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bergbok/Spicetify-Creations/main/Extensions/auto-skip-tracks-by-duration/dist/auto-skip-tracks-by-duration.js) (right-click the page and select _Save Page As..._)
2. Run `spicetify config-dir` in a terminal
3. Move `auto-skip-tracks-by-duration.js` into the Extensions folder
4. Run `spicetify config extensions auto-skip-tracks-by-duration.js`
